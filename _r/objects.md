title: Objects in R
---
Assign values to objects using the assignent operator, `<-`.

Objects can be variables, or more complicated things like functions.  When they've been assigned, objects are stored in the **workspace**, the contents of which you can see using `ls()`.

One cool thing that I didn't know until just now is that if you type `ls` without the parentheses, R will print the actual code for the `ls` function.

## Predefined objects

Object | Value
-------|----------
pi     | $$\pi$$
Inf    | $$\infty$$
