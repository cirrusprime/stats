title: Validity and reliability
---
These are not equivalent terms!

**Validity** is concerned with whether the measuring instrument actually measures what it sets out to, and that no other factors are able to influence the thing being measured/inferred from the measurements, whereas **reliability** is concerned with consistent interpretation of the instrument across different situations.
