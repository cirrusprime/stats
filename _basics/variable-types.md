title: Variable types
---
So, consider five distinct types of variable: binary, nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.  Binary, nominal, and ordinal variables are all types of *categorical* variables, and interval and ratio variables are types of *continuous* variables.

## Binary variables

Two possible categories.  That's it.  The boolean of statistics.  True or false.  Yes or no.  On or off.  Chicken or fish.

## Nominal variables

More than two possible categories, but in an unorderable way.  Like eye colour; there's no one eye colour that's "better" than any other, and while I'm sure someone out there would try to make that case, we're casually ignoring their existence, because why.

## Ordinal variables

More than two possible categories, but with a clear order.  Like degree classification (first, 2:1, 2:2, 3).

## Interval variables

May be better known as *discrete* variables.  They have the same interval difference between consecutive values, so $$x_{3} - x_{2} = x_{9} - x_{8}$$.

## Ratio variables

The sort of original continuous variables.  Much the same as interval variables in terms of equivalent differences and suchlike, but also similarly with ratios, in that $$x_{20} = 2 x_{10}$$.
